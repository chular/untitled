This is a simple Python program that allows you to play two number guessing games: one where you guess the number, and the other where the computer guesses the number.

## Features

- Two guessing games to choose from.
- User-friendly input prompts and feedback.
- Scoring system based on user performance.
- Award of 10 credits for high success rates after 10 attempts.

## Games

### 1. User Guesses the Number

In this game, you will try to guess the randomly generated number. The program will provide feedback after each guess until you guess the correct number.

### 2. Computer Guesses the Number

In this game, you think of a number within a specified range, and the computer will attempt to guess it. You provide feedback after each guess until the computer guesses correctly.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chular/untitled.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd number-guessing-game
    
3. Run the game by executing the Python script:

     For the user guessing game:
     ```bash
    python number_guess_user.py
     For the computer guessing game:
     ```bash
     python number_guess_computer.py
